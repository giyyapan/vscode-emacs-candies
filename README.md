# Emacs Candies
(Basicly for personal use)
Add some handy emacs-style command which can't be found elsewhere.
Requires [Emacs Keymap](https://github.com/hiro-sun/vscode-emacs.git).

# Available Commands
- cursorHome: move cursor to he beginning to the line, not jump between beginning of the line and the first character.
- killToEndOflLine: kill to end of line using Cut action, which will bring the line into clipboard
More will be added if something troubles me :p

** Enjoy! **
